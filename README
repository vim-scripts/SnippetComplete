DESCRIPTION
Insert mode abbreviations and snippets can dramatically speed up editing, but
how does one remember all those shortcuts that are rarely used? You can list
all insert mode abbreviations via :ia to break out of this vicious circle,
but switching to command mode for that is cumbersome.

This plugin offers a context-sensitive insert mode completion to quickly list
and complete defined abbreviations directly while typing.

SEE ALSO
- The SnippetCompleteSnipMate.vim plugin (vimscript #4276) extends the
  completion with snippets for the popular snipMate plugin (vimscript #2540).

USAGE
In insert mode, optionally type part of the snippet shortcut or a fragment
from its expected expansion, and invoke the snippet completion via CTRL-X ].
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X ]                Find matches for abbreviations that start with the
                        text in front of the cursor. If other snippet types
                        are registered, show those, too.
                        If no matches were found that way, matches anywhere in
                        the snippet or in the snippet's expanded text will be
                        shown. So if you can't remember the shortcut, but a
                        word fragment from the resulting expansion, just try
                        with that.

                        There are three types of abbreviations (full-id,
                        end-id and non-id), which can consist of different
                        characters. Thus, there can be more than one candidate
                        for the existing completion base, e.g. "pre@c" can
                        expand into a full-id abbreviation starting with "c"
                        or into a non-id one starting with "pre@c". The
                        completion indicates such a ambiguity through the
                        message "base n of m; next: blah", and you can cycle
                        through the different completion bases by repeating
                        the i_CTRL-X_] shortcut.

                        Matches are selected and inserted as with any other
                        ins-completion, see popupmenu-keys. If you use
                        <Space> or i_CTRL-] to select an abbreviation, it'll
                        be expanded automatically.
