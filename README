DESCRIPTION
Insert mode abbreviations and snippets can dramatically speed up editing, but
how does one remember all those shortcuts that are rarely used? You can list
all insert mode abbreviations via :ia to break out of this vicious circle,
but switching to command mode for that is cumbersome. 

This plugin offers a context-sensitive insert mode completion to quickly list
and complete defined abbreviations directly while typing. 

USAGE
i_CTRL-X_]		Find matches for abbreviations that start with the
			text in front of the cursor. 

			There are three types of abbreviations (full-id,
			end-id and non-id), which can consist of different
			characters. Thus, there can be more than one candidate
			for the existing completion base, e.g. "pre@c" can
			expand into a full-id abbreviation starting with "c"
			or into a non-id one starting with "pre@c". The
			completion indicates such a ambiguity through the
			message "base n of m; next: blah", and you can cycle
			through the different completion bases by repeating
			the i_CTRL-X_] shortcut. 

			Matches are selected and inserted as with any other
			ins-completion, see popupmenu-keys. If you use
			<Space> or i_CTRL-] to select an abbreviation, it'll
			be expanded automatically.
